# lildaq (WIP)

A lil' Data Acquisition System (DAQ) in the form of a lightweight CLI that collects serial input and dumps it with a timestamp to a local CSV file.  Built for Ardunio/IoT applications.  I built `lildaq` because I thought it would be cool if logging data from serial inputs from things like `Ardunio` projects was easier/more repeatable for me.  It would be even cooler if other folks get some use out of it too!


## Installation WIP

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies 
4. Navigate to the directory
5. Log data to your heart's content!


## Usage WIP


## Examples WIP



## Acknowledgements WIP
